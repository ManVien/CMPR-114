# Blackjack Simulation
# Previously in this chapter you saw the card_dealer.py program that simulates cards being
# dealt from a deck. Enhance the program so it simulates a simplified version of the game of
# Blackjack between two virtual players. The cards have the following values:
# Numeric cards are assigned the value they have printed on them. For example, the value
# of the 2 of spades is 2, and the value of the 5 of diamonds is 5.
# Jacks, queens, and kings are valued at 10.
# Aces are valued at 1 or 11, depending on the player’s choice.
# The program should deal cards to each player until one player’s hand is worth more than 21 points. 
# When that happens, the other player is the winner. (It is possible that both players’ hands will 
# simultaneously exceed 21 points, in which case neither player wins.)
# The program should repeat until all the cards have been dealt from the deck.
# If a player is dealt an ace, the program should decide the value of the card according to the
# following rule: The ace will be worth 11 points, unless that makes the player’s hand exceed
# 21 points. In that case, the ace will be worth 1 point.
