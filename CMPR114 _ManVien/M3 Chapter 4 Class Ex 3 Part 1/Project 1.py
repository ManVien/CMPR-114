# Project #1
# A program that will ask to enter the sales with commission 3x, without a loop

# Get a salesperson's sales and commission rate #1
sales = float(input('Enter the amount of sales: '))
comm_rate = float(input('Enter the commission rate: '))
#Calculate the commission.
commission = sales * comm_rate
# Display the commission.
print('The commission is $', format(commission, ',.2f'))

# Get another salesperson's sales and commission rate #2
sales = float(input('Enter the amount of sales: '))
comm_rate = float(input('Enter the commission rate: '))
# Calculate the commission.
commission = sales * comm_rate
# Display the commission.
print('The commission is $', format(commission, ',.2f'))

# Get another salesperson's sales and commission rate #3
sales = float(input('Enter the amount of sales: '))
comm_rate = float(input('Enter the commission rate: '))
# Calculate the commission.
commission = sales * comm_rate
# Display the commission.
